# 🐿️ Squirrel Census Data Analysis – Portfolio Project

This portfolio showcases my **in-depth analysis** of the 2018 Central Park Squirrel Census dataset. Through a combination of **data cleaning, EDA, visualizations, and geospatial mapping**, I explore the behaviors, distribution, and ecological patterns of squirrels in New York City's iconic Central Park.

---

## 📌 About the Dataset

- **Source:** NYC Open Data ([Link](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/))
- **Records:** ~3,000+ squirrel sightings
- **Features:** Age, fur color, location, behavior, time of day, and more

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify squirrel population trends by age, color, and behavior
- Explore shift-based (AM/PM) activity patterns
- Rank plots based on ecological balance (Eco Score vs Stress Score)
- Discover ideal zones and times for squirrel observation
- Deep-dive analysis of **Plot 8** – a behavior-rich ecological hotspot

---

## 🧪 Techniques Used

- 🧹 Data Cleaning (NaNs, categorical fixes)
- 📊 EDA using Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib
- 🗺️ Folium for interactive map visualization
- 🧮 Custom Eco Index = Eco Score − Stress Score
- 📌 Plot-level segmentation and ranking

---

## 🌟 Key Insights

- **Plot 8** emerged as the most ecologically active and balanced zone
- Squirrel behaviors vary significantly by **shift** and **plot**
- Certain fur colors dominate specific plots or age groups
- Eco-positive plots tend to have higher activity and interaction rates

---

## 🖼️ Project Outputs

- 📈 Age & Fur Color distribution charts
- 🌍 Folium map showing squirrel sighting locations
- 🔥 Behavior heatmaps
- 🧠 Plot ranking based on Net Eco Index
